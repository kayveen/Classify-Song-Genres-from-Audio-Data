# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

This project is from DataCamp projects. They provide the Dataset, the context,
and some instructions, but you can add other things if you want. You can find the project
on Datacamp : https://www.datacamp.com/projects/449

## Project Description

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), you will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). You will first make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors you should be aware of when doing machine learning. Next, you will use the scikit-learn package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. You will go over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
